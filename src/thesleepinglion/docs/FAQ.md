# FAQ

## Do you own the assets used by The Sleeping Lion?
***No***. I do not own any asset used, nor are the cards used as examples of my own making. These assets were graciously shared by Isaac Childres, the creator of Gloomhaven and are shared under creative commons license BY-NC-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). You can find his original post [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1733586/files-creation).

Using this app to create your own characters does not make you the owner of any or part of the assets.

## How did you come up with the name "The Sleeping Lion"?
I did not create the name "The Sleeping Lion", nor do I own it: it is part of the Gloomhaven board game and is the name of the inn where the players initially start their journey.

## Do I have to cite The Sleeping Lion?

Strictly speaking, no. The Sleeping Lion doesn't put watermarks of any kind (for example on the generated PDFs): it is as if you made them using any other editor. GML files do not store specific metadata: they are mostly text files, and technically can be generated using any text editor.

However, citations or thanks are always welcome, as they help to get others to know about The Sleeping Lion. If you feel like this project was helpful, please consider naming it ("I generated the cards using The Sleeping Lion") and giving a link to the GitHub repository (a simple Google search of "The Sleeping Lion" may not yield satisfying results).

The Sleeping Lion is licensed under the MIT License.


## How can I contribute to The Sleeping Lion?

Using The Sleeping Lion and sharing your custom mercenaries using the GML format is already a great start! It helps reaching out to new users and increases this project's visibility.

If you find a bug, a typo, or if you think of a new feature you'd like to be added, feel free to open an issue on Github! This sort of feedback is very important, because it helps show where things are unclear or feel weird to use.

Finally, if you've got some coding experience and want to contribute, you can always open a pull request!
